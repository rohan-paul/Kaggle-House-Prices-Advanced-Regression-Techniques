You can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the Data page.

## Table of Contents

1. [Executive Summary](#executive-summary)

5. [Metric](#metric)

## Executive Summary

**Goal**

It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

## Metric

Submissions are evaluated on [Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

## Notes on the data

There are 1460 instances of training data and 1460 of test data. Total number of attributes equals 81, of which 36 are numerical, 43 are categorical + Id and SalePrice.
